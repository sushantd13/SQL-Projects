# SQL-Project
Hello reader,
I worked on an interesting project where I used SQL to analyse insights from pizza restaurant sales data. I learnt how to use extract, join, group, and aggregate data to obtain insights about customer behaviour, sales trends, and operational patterns andÂ use sales data to inform data-driven decisions.
